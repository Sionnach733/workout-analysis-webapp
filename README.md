# workout-analysis-webapp
This app takes training data and represents it in bubble charts, so you can quickly see what movements are overtrained/neglected.
Can filter on different stages of workout(warmup,strength,skills,wod)
Primitives allows you to view movements in simplest form(ie overhead squat and front squat would be simplified to squat, running/rowing/bike would be simplified to cardio, etc)
